But in this case, each test method is self-contained, designed specifically for its test scenario and doesn\u0027t depend on other classes in a way that it can be relocated.\n\nAdditionally, the testing methods testSingleClustering() and testSingleClusteringReversed() are placed correctly in the class StaticColumnsQueryTest which is the appropriate class for testing the StaticColumnsQuery part of the codebase.","iteration-4":"Apologies, but this code doesn\u0027t seem like it needs any move method refactoring.

No method here is suitable for moving to a different class, since they all appear to be highly dependent on the context of `StaticColumnsQueryTest`. \n\nMove method refactoring needs methods that are more coupled to a data class other than the one they are currently present in. Such methods get most of their data from other objects. Here, test methods are serving their purpose in their current positions.","iteration-5":"Based on the given code snippet, it\u0027s hard to find a move method refactoring operation. The `testSingleClustering` and `testSingleClusteringReversed` methods in `StaticColumnsQueryTest` class are functioning as expected for their responsibility - they are testing specific scenarios related to the class.\n\nHowever, as a good practice, repetitive blocks of codes in these methods can be modularized into new methods to make the code more concise and readable.\n\nGiven this is a testing class, methods belong to the class they are testing, hence moving these methods to other place might not be a good practice and may not enhance the design of the code.
