            Please provide suggestions to improve the following Java method/class. 
            Your task is to identify methods that do not belong to the class and suggest an appropriate class to move them.
            Only provide suggestions that are: Move Method.
                
                
            Ensure that your recommendations are specific to this method/class and are actionable immediately. 
            Your response should be formatted as a JSON list of objects. Each object should comprise of the following fields. 
            The first field, named "method_name", should be the name of the method that needs to move.
            The second field, names "method_signature", should be the signature of the method that needs to move.
            The third field, "target_class" is the class it should move to.
            The fourth field "rationale", is the reason why it should be moved.
