    Converts a conventional for-loop to an enhanced for-loop where applicable.

    This function is intended to refactor code by replacing conventional for-loops with enhanced for-loops (also known as 
    "foreach" loops) where applicable, starting from the specified line number `line_start`. It assumes that the necessary 
    updates to the source code are handled externally.

    Parameters:
    - line_start (int): The line number from which to start searching for conventional for-loops to convert. Must be a positive integer.
